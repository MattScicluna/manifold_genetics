"""The check that stands between a working directory and a public repository.

Written because it has already happened here twice. A `git add -A examples/`
swept seven untracked files into a pull request on a public repo, one of them a
script headed "Private script ... NOT for external users". Then the 0.2.0 source
distribution, built from the working tree, contained thirteen untracked files
including local tool state with cluster paths in it.

Neither was caught by review; both were caught by accident. The lesson is not
"be careful" -- it is that a working directory on a machine with controlled-access
data is not a safe thing to bulk-add from, and that the check has to be
mechanical.

These tests are the specification of what counts as sensitive. Every rule here
corresponds to something that actually leaked or nearly did.
