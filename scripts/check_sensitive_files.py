"""Flag files that should not leave a machine holding controlled-access data.

This exists because of two incidents, both on a repository that is public:

* A ``git add -A examples/`` swept seven untracked files into a pull request,
  one of them a script whose own header says "NOT for external users".
* The 0.2.0 source distribution, built from the working tree, contained
  thirteen untracked files including agent tool state with cluster paths in it.

Neither was caught by review. The conclusion is not that more care is needed --
it is that a working directory on a cluster holding UK Biobank and All of Us
data is not a safe thing to bulk-add from, and that the check must be mechanical
and run before the commit rather than after the push.

Run it over specific paths (what the pre-commit hook does)::

    python -m scripts.check_sensitive_files path/to/file ...

or over everything git is tracking or about to track::

    python -m scripts.check_sensitive_files --staged
    python -m scripts.check_sensitive_files --tracked

Every rule below corresponds to something that leaked or nearly did. To allow a
specific path, add it to ``.sensitive-allow`` with a comment saying why: an
override should leave a reviewable trace in the repository, not be a flag
somebody types once and forgets.
